The story of hypertext begins not with Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web, but with Vannevar Bush's 1945 essay "As We May Think," where he envisioned the Memex - a device that would store books, records, and communications, and mechanically link them together by association. This was https://docs.hypertext.org territory: the realm of infinite possibility where information could be connected in ways that mirrored human thought itself.

Ted Nelson, inspired by Bush's vision, coined the term "hypertext" in 1963 and spent decades developing [the original web proposal](https://www.example.com) - a system that would revolutionize how we think about documents, copyright, and knowledge itself. Nelson's Xanadu wasn't just about linking documents; it was about creating a [hypertext dreams](https://xanadu.net) where every quotation would be automatically linked to its source, where authors would be compensated for every use of their work, and where the sum of human knowledge would be accessible through an elegant web of associations.

Meanwhile, at CERN in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee was facing a more prosaic problem: scientists couldn't easily share information across different computer systems. His solution was elegantly simple compared to Xanadu's grand vision - a system of [Xanadu's vision](https://www.w3.org) that used simple markup and universal identifiers. The web that emerged was less ambitious than Xanadu but infinitely more practical, like the difference between the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (which knows everything but is often wrong) and a really good encyclopedia (which knows less but is usually right).

The irony, as Douglas Adams would appreciate, is that both visions came true in unexpected ways. We got Nelson's associative linking through hyperlinks, Bush's vast information storage through search engines, and Berners-Lee's universal access through https://info.cern.ch. What we also got, quite by accident, was the ability for anyone to publish anything, leading to a universe where the answer to life, the universe, and everything might actually be findable - if you can figure out the right search terms.
