In 1945, Vannevar Bush published "As We May Think" in The Atlantic Monthly, describing a device called the Memex that would store vast amounts of information and allow users to create associative trails between documents. This wasn't just science fiction - it was a blueprint for what would eventually become the World Wide Web, though it would take nearly half a century and the combined genius of visionaries like Ted Nelson and Tim Berners-Lee to make it reality.

Ted Nelson's Xanadu project, begun in the 1960s, was perhaps the most ambitious of these visions. Nelson didn't just want to link documents - he wanted to create a [digital preservation](https://web.archive.org) where every piece of text would maintain its connection to its source, where authors would be automatically compensated for quotations, and where the entire corpus of human knowledge would be navigable through what he called "transclusion" - the ability to include parts of documents within other documents while maintaining their original context.

The web that Tim Berners-Lee actually created at CERN was more modest but infinitely more practical. Instead of Nelson's complex bidirectional links and micropayment systems, Berners-Lee opted for simple one-way links and free access. His [collaborative development](https://github.com/worldwideweb) included three fundamental technologies: HTML for structuring documents, HTTP for transferring them, and URLs for addressing them. The first website, https://developer.mozilla.org, went live in 1991 and explained what the World Wide Web was.

As Douglas Adams might have observed, the web's success came not from solving the problem of information organization (which it spectacularly failed to do), but from making information sharing so easy that organization became someone else's problem. Search engines like Google became the Babel fish of the internet - universal translators that could find meaning in the chaos. The [web standards](https://www.whatwg.org) that emerged wasn't the elegant, structured knowledge space that Nelson envisioned, but rather something more like the Hitchhiker's Guide itself: vast, mostly harmless, occasionally accurate, and utterly indispensable.

Today, as we grapple with issues of misinformation, platform monopolies, and digital rights, Nelson's original vision of [living documents](https://semantic-web.org) seems more relevant than ever. The IndieWeb movement, blockchain-based publishing, and efforts to create more equitable creator compensation systems all echo Xanadu's core principles. Perhaps, as Adams suggested about the universe, the web isn't finished yet - it's still in beta, and the real version is still being debugged.

The ultimate irony is that both Bush's Memex and Nelson's Xanadu were designed to augment human intelligence and creativity, while the web we actually got often seems designed to distract us from both. But then again, as any reader of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy knows, the most important thing about any technology isn't what it was designed to do, but what people actually do with it. And what people have done with the web - from https://linked-data.org to https://microformats.org - has been nothing short of extraordinary, even if it wasn't quite what anyone originally had in mind.
